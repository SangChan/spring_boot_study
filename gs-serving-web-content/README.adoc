This guide walks you through the process of creating a "hello world" web site with Spring.

== What you'll build

You'll build a service that will accept HTTP GET requests at:

    http://localhost:8080/greeting

and respond with a web page displaying a greeting:

    "Hello, World!"

You can customize the greeting with an optional `name` parameter in the query string:

    http://localhost:8080/greeting?name=User

The `name` parameter value overrides the default value of "World" and is reflected in the response:

    "Hello, User!"

== Create a web controller

In Spring's approach to building web sites, HTTP requests are handled by a controller. You can easily identify these requests by the {Controller}[`@Controller`] annotation. In the following example, the GreetingController handles GET requests for /greeting by returning the name of a {View}[`View`], in this case, "greeting". A `View` is responsible for rendering the HTML content:

`src/main/java/hello/GreetingController.java`
[source,java]
----
include::complete/src/main/java/hello/GreetingController.java[]
----

This controller is concise and simple, but there's plenty going on. Let's break it down step by step.

The `@RequestMapping` annotation ensures that HTTP requests to `/greeting` are mapped to the `greeting()` method.

NOTE: The above example does not specify `GET` vs. `PUT`, `POST`, and so forth, because `@RequestMapping` maps all HTTP operations by default. Use `@RequestMapping(method=GET)` to narrow this mapping.

{RequestParam}[`@RequestParam`] binds the value of the query String parameter `name` into the `name` parameter of the `greeting()` method. This query String parameter is not `required`; if it is absent in the request, the `defaultValue` of "World" is used. The value of the `name` parameter is added to a {Model}[`Model`] object, ultimately making it accessible to the view template.

The implementation of the method body relies on a link:/understanding/view-templates[view technology], in this case http://www.thymeleaf.org/doc/html/Thymeleaf-Spring3.html[Thymeleaf], to perform server-side rendering of the HTML. Thymeleaf parses the `greeting.html` template below and evaluates the `th:text` expression to render the value of the `${name}` parameter that was set in the controller.

`src/main/resources/templates/greeting.html`

== Make the application executable

Although it is possible to package this service as a traditional link:/understanding/WAR[WAR] file for deployment to an external application server, the simpler approach demonstrated below creates a standalone application. You package everything in a single, executable JAR file, driven by a good old Java `main()` method. Along the way, you use Spring's support for embedding the link:/understanding/Tomcat[Tomcat] servlet container as the HTTP runtime, instead of deploying to an external instance.


`src/main/java/hello/Application.java`
[source,java]
----
include::complete/src/main/java/hello/Application.java[]
----

The `main()` method defers to the {SpringApplication}[`SpringApplication`] helper class, providing `Application.class` as an argument to its `run()` method. This tells Spring to read the annotation metadata from `Application` and to manage it as a component in the link:/understanding/application-context[Spring application context].

The {ComponentScan}[`@ComponentScan`] annotation tells Spring to search recursively through the `hello` package and its children for classes marked directly or indirectly with Spring's {Component}[`@Component`] annotation. This directive ensures that Spring finds and registers the `GreetingController`, because it is marked with {Controller}[`@Controller`], which in turn is a kind of {Component}[`@Component`] annotation.

The {EnableAutoConfiguration}[`@EnableAutoConfiguration`] annotation switches on reasonable default behaviors based on the content of your classpath. For example, because the application depends on the embeddable version of Tomcat (tomcat-embed-core.jar), a Tomcat server is set up and configured with reasonable defaults on your behalf. And because the application also depends on Spring MVC (spring-webmvc.jar), a Spring MVC {DispatcherServlet}[`DispatcherServlet`] is configured and registered for you â€” no `web.xml` necessary! Auto-configuration is a powerful, flexible mechanism. See the {EnableAutoConfiguration}[API documentation] for further details.

:module: service
include::https://raw.githubusercontent.com/spring-guides/getting-started-macros/master/run_the_application_with_both.adoc[]

Logging output is displayed. The service should be up and running within a few seconds.


== Test the service

Now that the web site is running, visit http://localhost:8080/greeting, where you see:

    "Hello, World!"

Provide a `name` query string parameter with http://localhost:8080/greeting?name=User. Notice how the message changes from "Hello, World!" to "Hello, User!":

    "Hello, User!"

This change demonstrates that the {RequestParam}[`@RequestParam`] arrangement in `GreetingController` is working as expected. The `name` parameter has been given a default value of "World", but can always be explicitly overridden through the query string.


== Summary

Congratulations! You have just developed a web page using Spring.
