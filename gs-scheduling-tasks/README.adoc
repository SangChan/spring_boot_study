This guide walks you through the steps for scheduling tasks with Spring.

== What you'll build

You'll build an application the prints out the current time every five seconds using Spring's `@Scheduled` annotation.

== Create a scheduled task
Now that you've set up your project, you can create a scheduled task.

`src/main/java/hello/ScheduledTasks.java`
[source,java]
----
include::complete/src/main/java/hello/ScheduledTasks.java[]
----

The key components that make this code perform scheduled tasks are the `@EnableScheduling` and `@Scheduled` annotations. 

`@EnableScheduling` ensures that a background task executor is created. Without it, nothing gets scheduled. 

You use `@Scheduled` to configure when a particular method is run.
NOTE: This example uses `fixedRate`, which specifies the interval between method invocations measured from the start time of each invocation. There are http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/{spring_version}/spring-framework-reference/html/scheduling.html#scheduling-annotation-support-scheduled[other options], like `fixedDelay`, which specifies the interval between invocations measured from the completion of the task. You can also http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/{spring_version}/javadoc-api/org/springframework/scheduling/support/CronSequenceGenerator.html[use `@Scheduled(cron=". . .")` expressions for more sophisticated task scheduling].

NOTE: This app doesn't use `@EnableAutoConfiguration` like many of the other guides. That's because Spring Boot doesn't have anything to auto-configure when it comes to scheduling. But
if you combine this guide with some of the others, don't forget to add it if needed.


== Make the application executable

Although scheduled tasks can be embedded in web apps and WAR files, the simpler approach demonstrated below creates a standalone application. You package everything in a single, executable JAR file, driven by a good old Java `main()` method.


Here you create a new `SpringApplication` and run it with the `ScheduledTasks` you defined earlier. This action creates a task executor and allows tasks to be scheduled."

`src/main/java/hello/Application.java`
[source,java]

include::https://raw.githubusercontent.com/spring-guides/getting-started-macros/master/build_an_executable_jar_with_both.adoc[]


:module: service
include::https://raw.githubusercontent.com/spring-guides/getting-started-macros/master/run_the_application_with_both.adoc[]

Logging output is displayed. You should see your scheduled task fire every 5 seconds:

....
[...]
The time is now 13:10:00
The time is now 13:10:05
The time is now 13:10:10
The time is now 13:10:15
....

== Summary

Congratulations! You created an application with a scheduled task. Heck, the actual code was shorter than the build file! This technique works in any type of application.
