This guide walks you through the process of wrapping database operations with non-intrusive transactions.

== What you'll build

You'll build a simple JDBC application wherein you make database operations transactional without having to write http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/jdbc/basics/transactions.html#commit_transactions[specialized JDBC code].

== Create a booking service
First, use the `BookingService` class to create a JDBC-based service that books people into the system by name. 

`src/main/java/hello/BookingService.java`
[source,java]
----
include::complete/src/main/java/hello/BookingService.java[]
----

The code has an autowired `JdbcTemplate`, a handy template class that does all the database interactions needed by the code below.

You also have a `book` method aimed at booking multiple people. It loops through the list of people, and for each person, inserts them into the `BOOKINGS` table using the `JdbcTemplate`. This method is tagged with `@Transactional`, meaning that any failure causes the entire operation to roll back to its previous state, and to re-throw the original exception. This means that none of the people will be added to `BOOKINGS` if one person fails to be added.

You also have a `findAllBookings` method to query the database. Each row fetched from the database is converted into a `String` and then assembled into a `List`.

== Build an application
`src/main/java/hello/Application.java`
[source,java]
----
include::complete/src/main/java/hello/Application.java[]
----

You configure your beans in the `Application` configuration class. The `bookingService` method wires in an instance of `BookingService`.

As shown earlier in this guide, `JdbcTemplate` is autowired into `BookingService`, meaning you now need to define it in the `Application` code:
    
NOTE: `SimpleDriverDataSource` is a convenience class and is _not_ intended for production. For production, you usually want some sort of JDBC connection pool to handle multiple requests coming in simultaneously.

The `jdbcTemplate` method where you create an instance of `JdbcTemplate` also contains some DDL to declare the `BOOKINGS` table.

NOTE: In production systems, database tables are usually declared outside the application.

The `main()` method defers to the {SpringApplication}[`SpringApplication`] helper class, providing `Application.class` as an argument to its `run()` method. This tells Spring to read the annotation metadata from `Application` and to manage it as a component in the _link:/understanding/application-context[Spring application context]_.

Note two especially valuable parts of this application configuration:

- `@EnableTransactionManagement` activates Spring's seamless transaction features, which makes `@Transactional` function.
- {EnableAutoConfiguration}[`@EnableAutoConfiguration`] switches on reasonable default behaviors based on the content of your classpath. For example, it detects that you have **spring-tx** on the path as well as a `DataSource`, and automatically creates the other beans needed for transactions. Auto-configuration is a powerful, flexible mechanism. See the {EnableAutoConfiguration}[API documentation] for further details.

You should see the following output:

....

The `BOOKINGS` table has two constraints on the **first_name** column:

- Names cannot be longer than five characters.
- Names cannot be null.

The first three names inserted are **Alice**, **Bob**, and **Carol**. The application asserts that three people were added to that table. If that had not worked, the application would have exited early.

Next, another booking is done for **Chris** and **Samuel**. Samuel's name is deliberately too long, forcing an insert error. Transactional behavior stipulates that both Chris and Samuel; that is, this transaction, should be rolled back. Thus there should still be only three people in that table, which the assertion demonstrates.

Finally, **Buddy** and **null** are booked. As the output shows, null causes a rollback as well, leaving the same three people booked.

== Summary
Congratulations! You've just used Spring to develop a simple JDBC application wrapped with non-intrusive transactions.
